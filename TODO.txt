number of users, total and by month
if too few, get more (tw, pan, etc.)

Nice test case
Photos - 8km from "43.695949", "7.271413", since 2000-01
nb months: 12*16=192
nb=134130
unique users: 7761
-> 40 users per month
Number of users with location text: 4297
-> 22 users per month

Number of unique user location text: 2188

yearly time resolution?
